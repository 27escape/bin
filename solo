# Usage:

# solo -port=PORT COMMAND

# where
#     PORT        some arbitrary port number to be used for locking
#     COMMAND     shell command to run

# options
#     -verbose    be verbose
#     -silent     be silent

# Use it like this:
# * * * * * solo -port=3801 ./job.pl blah blah

# The script job.pl will run every minute, but only if the previous one has finished.
# (Of course, you can use different parameters, if it doesn't have to run it every minute.)
